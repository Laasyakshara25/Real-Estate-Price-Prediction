# Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts real estate prices using machine learning regression techniques, including **Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**, and **Random Forest Regressor**. It covers the entire machine learning lifecycle from data preprocessing to model deployment via a **Streamlit** web application.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**: For model training, data manipulation, and analysis
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the model in an interactive web app

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone # Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning
